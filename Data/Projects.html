                        <h3>Description</h3>
                        Eti's Adventure is a metroidvania game that focuses on two different approaches, one related to
                        puzzles and
                        the other related to parkour. Their are different varieties of puzzles in the puzzle mode, some
                        of which are based
                        around gamified established questions. The first part of the game is completed. Hopefully the
                        experience of the game
                        is positive for all of you!

                        <h3>Features</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The game includes multiple mobs/Entities including the player with different trades
                                (i.e., movement, jumping
                                , shooting, etc.)</li>
                            <li>The game has two different puzzle functionalities, both serving the purpose of testing
                                players ability to logically
                                and abstractly think. The two modes are :
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The IqQuestionPuzzle class is used to generate a puzzle based around the data
                                        that it is provided
                                        (using gamification of real Iq questions based on pattern finding)</li>
                                    <li>The MatcherPuzzleGenerator class is used to generate a puzzle based on data that
                                        is provided through manual
                                        designing</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>The game has a built in save system that allows players to save their state and carry on
                                from the last save point</li>
                            <li>The game has a feedback system used to provide feedback regarding questions that the
                                players have attempted. This feedback
                                system is primarily used for IqQuestionPuzzles
                            </li>
                            <li> The game includes different maps for the players to play in including maps that focus
                                on parkour as opposed to puzzles
                                to increase the longevity of the game
                            </li>
                            <li>more features such as portals, keys, doors, boss fights, moving platforms, etc. to give
                                the game more depth</li>

                        <h3>Description</h3>
                        The Daily Task Website was a small scale project that I set for myself to improve my web
                        development skills. It was
                        created from scratch (without templates) using HTML, CSS and Javascript. JQuery was used was
                        better file management and
                        loading. The main purpose of the website was to provide users with a platform where they can set
                        daily tasks for themselves
                        while using the gamification methodology to increase motivation and interest

                        <h3>Features</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The website allows users to add and delete daily tasks and processes them by their due
                                date</li>
                            <li>There are three primary pages for the website. They are as follows :
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The Daily Task Page : This is used to show the tasks of the current day as well
                                        as upcoming tasks with the
                                        filter of changing the upcoming date to 1, 3 or 7 respectively. User can
                                        complete or delete the daily tasks
                                        available for the current day.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>The Shop Page : This page includes a table that the user creates themselves. The
                                        purpose of this page is to
                                        hold items that the user can buy based around the amount of points that the
                                        users have earned through completing
                                        daily tasks
                                    </li>
                                    <li>The All Task Page : This page includes a table that of all the tasks that the
                                        user have added to the system. They can
                                        delete any task that they have added. This page also allows user to add tasks
                                        for the future.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Currently, the website uses the browser's local storage to save the current points,
                                tasks, shop items, etc.</li>
                            <li>All of the functionality was done in JavaScript (The main purpose was to test/improve my
                                skills in JS)
                            </li>

                        <h3>Improvements</h3>
                        <div>The next step is to create a similar app using a database to store all of the user's
                            information. Current plan is
                            to use express.js and mysql for the development phase. The next feature is the introduction
                            of milestones that can consist
                            of a number of tasks and provide more points once all the tasks are completed

                        <div>The next step is to create a similar app using a database to store all of the user's

                            of a number of tasks and provide more points once all the tasks are completed

                        <h3>Description</h3>
                        As a software engineering student, I always had a desire to create a website that displays
                        information regarding myself,
                        my achievements and my projects. For this website, I started from scratch, not using a template,
                        so I could test my
                        web development knowledge. This also allowed me to completely design my website. The portfolio
                        shows all of my work experience,
                        my education, extra curriculars, interests, etc.
                        <br>
                        This Portfolio also allows me to show my web designing skills as it uses HTML and vanilla css
                        with a hint of javascript for
                        smoother transitions.
                        <h3>Improvements</h3>
                        <div>There is a lot that I want to cover within the portfolio, however, there needs to be a
                            balance of the amount of information
                            that I provide with the general design of the website. I want to keep on updating this
                            portfolio further as I learn new skills
                            or enhance previously learned skills, complete more projects and in the future, even add a
                            page specifically for showing my day
                            to day life
